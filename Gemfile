### OpenShift Online changes:

# Fix the conflict with the system 'rake':
gem 'rake'

# Support for databases and environment.
# Use 'sqlite3' for testing and development and mysql and postgresql
# for production.
#
# To speed up the 'git push' process you can exclude gems from bundle install:
# For example, if you use rails + mysql, you can:
#
# $ rhc env set BUNDLE_WITHOUT="development test postgresql"
#
group :development, :test do
  gem 'sqlite3'
  gem 'minitest'
  gem 'thor'
end

# Add support for the MySQL
group :production, :mysql do
  gem 'mysql2'
end

group :production, :postgresql do
  gem 'pg'
end
